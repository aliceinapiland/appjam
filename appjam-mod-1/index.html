      <google-codelab-step label="Introduction" duration="0">
        <p>Welcome to the AppSheet App Jam! During this lab we will explore how to create our first AppSheet app and the different features the platform offers. Keep in mind that the intention of this lab is to give a high overview of the solution and help you initiate into the citizen developer&#39;s world! Let&#39;s start!</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Pre-requisites:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A Google Account</li>
</ul>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Loging into AppSheet" duration="0">

</ol>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Create an app" duration="0">
        <ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Do click under My Apps. An overlay frame will allow you to choose between &#34;Start with your data&#34;, &#34;Start with an idea&#34; or &#34;Start with a sample app&#34;. During this short lab, we will explore a sample app. Click &#34;Start with a sample app&#34;.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 1027.50px" src="img/4410898bd03fdd3c.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Select a name for your app. In this case we will use AppSheetLab1. Under categories, select Logistics. Select Shipment Tracking as the sample app to deploy.</li>
<li>Wait until the new app is set up.</li>
<li>Close the pop-up informational help tool.</li>
</ol>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Exploring the AppSheet interface" duration="0">
        <p>AppSheet divides its interface in 4 main locations:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/f37e81162e9bae10.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Top bar menu: Here we can go back to the main AppSheet webpage, review our team&#39;s work, explore more sample apps, connect with support and go into settings for our own account.</li>
<li>Left navigation bar: We will explore this bar during the lab. It has information about the data we are connecting with, the interfaces we will use in our app, workflows and behaviors, security settings or special features like intelligence. We can also manage access to our apps and further settings of our current application.</li>
<li>Right live preview app: Every change we make in the app will be reflected in this fully functional app in the right. If we make a change in the interface, the change will be automatically reflected in the preview so we can continuously acknowledge all the changes we might want to do.</li>
<li>Main panel: Here is where we will perform most of the changes once we select the different options in the left navigation bar.</li>
</ol>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Exploring the source of data" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Tables and Columns</h2>
<p>Tables are comprised of columns, which identify the different components of each record. A record is a row of data in your spreadsheet. For instance, a table of addresses would have a column each for street number, street name, city, state, and zip code. Rows contain the data for each individual piece. For the address example, each address would have its own row.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>In the Left navigation bar, click on Data.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/7d7b0f8e26fe07fa.png"></p>
<p>We now see four different tables: Users, Vendors, Building_Sites and Delivery_Packages. Click on Users.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Under the different tabs, we can see Storage, Security, Scale, Localization and Documentation.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The first one, Storage, gives us information about the source of the data, in this case, Google Sheets.</li>
<li>The second one, Security, gives us Security measures to prevent information to be shown in the application or restrict visibility of the table depending on the role of the user accessing the app.</li>
<li>The third one, Scale, gives us the possibility of sourcing the data under different worksheets (with Business Plan).</li>
<li>Localization, the forth one, identifies the locale or language the worksheet is. This will help auto detecting fields and columns.</li>
<li>Documentation, the last one, let&#39;s you comment this table for other collaborators to better align with the content of the same.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Click in View Source. This will open a new tab in your browser with the worksheet you are using as the main data source of your application. Explore the different tabs and fields to see the different intents of the application.<img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/d6159f1c2a1dea7.png"></li>
<li>Go back to AppSheet and, just besides View Source, click on View Columns. This will swap the main panel with information about the data columns and how AppSheet interpreted the fields in the worksheet. If we click on one of the edit icons of each field, we open a contextual menu with more information to change about these fields. In this example click on the edit button of User_Name. 1.We want to change the display name of this field. For that, we will scroll to the DISPLAY NAME column and click to open the menu. Let&#39;s change the display name of this field to Name. Click on the text box and the Expression Assistant will open. Get familiarized with this Expression Assistant since it is a powerful tool to create conditions, expressions, deep links and auto-generate values in many of the contexts of AppSheet. Write Name in the text box. Click Save and then Done.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/ff6e099834ac0c2a.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>To see the changes reflected on our preview application we need to save the application. Click on the Save button, top right corner of the Top bar menu.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/c59c2f31fedd0d51.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="5">
<li>Now, in the application, click in the menu to display the different data sources added to the app. The click on Users.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 373.00px" src="img/83e883c4657f2353.png"></p>
<p>Select one of the users by clicking on it. As you can see, the Name field has a display customization.</p>
<ol type="1" start="6">
<li>One last thing to notice in this brief lab, is the reference columns. In this case, the last three entries of this table: Related Building_Sites, Related Delivery_Packages and Related Building_Sites By Site_Contact. These three fields are used to establish a relationship between tables. If we click on the FORMULA text field, the Expression Assistant will show up and we can see how to reference columns to other rows in different tables. In this case, the vale of Site_Admin must be equal to UserId, which is a Key field in this table.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a quick look at the table Delivery_Packages as we did for Users. Review its columns as well. Notice the different FORMULA and SHOW? fields where we decide if we show the field based on the content of the same.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Slices" duration="0">
        <p>When you show the contents of a table in your app, you do not need to show every row, every column, and every action. Instead, you can &#34;slice&#34; the data by choosing a subset of the columns, actions, and rows. A slice is a subset of the rows, columns, and actions of a table.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Go to the Slices menu on top of the main panel and select Delivered. Notice that this slice has a condition: [Package_Status]=Delivered. This condition provides a row filter (show/not show). If the Package_Status has the value Delivered, then the row will be shown in the slice. If not, the row will be hidden.</li>
<li>Under Slice Columns, we can select all the columns or just select those columns that we want to show in this slice. You can remove Package_Driver by clicking the trash icon at the right of this column.</li>
<li>Within the app preview, click on Overview in the navigation bar. Scroll down until Delivered and select one of the delivered packages.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 371.00px" src="img/d2aa14f417318a54.png"></p>
<p>You should be able to see that all the Package_Driver is not present any more. Test a few fields and, at any time, if you want to recover the fields into the slice, click on the &#39;Add&#39; button at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/3e196fa4e34cf9b1.png"></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Exploring views" duration="0">
        <p>Let&#39;s focus now on views. Views allow you to control how, when, and where data is presented to the app user, and how the user interacts with the data. For that, click on UX under the navigation bar. Under the Views tab, we have 3 different options, Create views, Primary views and Menu views. We can also search for specific views (this is really handy when we have rich and powerful apps).</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/eacdbf30613dd7b3.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Let&#39;s click on Drivers in the Primary Views category.</li>
<li>Now, in the app preview section, click the Drivers icon in the navigation bar to see real-time changes in the app.</li>
<li>We are going to change the view type from Table to Gallery.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 388.00px" src="img/8b9429ccdf683f9b.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>In this view, we are showing pictures and names of the Delivery_Packages. This is not useful when searching by Drivers so, under For this data, change it Users. The changes should be reflected immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 390.00px" src="img/87783adb4565f2e4.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="5">
<li>Finally, one last change before we move on. Let&#39;s sort the list by User_Name. To do this, under View Options, click Add and select User_Name as the sorting option.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/5fe1f7b29000116a.png"></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Exploring Behavior" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Actions</h2>
<p>By default, standard behaviors are automatically applied to every app based on the structure of the data (tables and slices). As the app creator, you can change and augment these standard behaviors. The Behavior tab of the editor is the place to make these changes.</p>
<p>The primary behavioral concept is an action. An action is an operation that changes the state of the app. Some of the actions are automatically defined by the system (system-defined) and can be modified by you, the app creator. You can also explicitly create new actions.</p>
<p>For this lab, we will explore one of the current actions.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>On the Left Navigation bar, click on Behavior. This will show the current actions assigned in the sample app.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/a2091f8339ca8658.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>For the sake of simplicity, we will review Delivery_Time. Click on that behavior to see the implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/123ea282f8742100.png"></p>
<p>The important piece to understand is the flow of a behavior: &#34;For a record of a table, do this by setting these columns&#34;. In this case:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>For Delivery_Packages table, set the values of some columns in this row, these columns being Delivery_Time with the value NOW(). In other words, whenever we drop off a package, we set the delivery time to the current time.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 333.00px" src="img/b51a2efe29519f4a.png"></p>
<p>Try yourself to drop off a package and see how the field changes.</p>
<p>Feel free to explore more complex actions in this example or even create/update actions to test the flow in the app preview.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Workflows</h2>
<p>It is important to trigger certain actions whenever something happens that might need to go outside of the application. For example, send an email to the customer once the package has been delivered or send a webhook to a certain external app that would trigger a complex business workflow in another system. You can do this easily with workflows.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s explore what happens here when a package is assigned to a driver.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/7643fb76394e150a.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Click on the section When this happens...: Based on a target data (Delivery_Packages), on an add only action.</li>
<li>Click on the section If this is true: Only if the added data fits this condition:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>AND([_thisrow_before].[Package_Driver] &lt;&gt; [_thisrow_after].[Package_Driver],ISNOTBLANK([Package_Driver]),[Package_Status]=&#34;Assigned&#34;)</code></pre>
<p>Basically, if we assigned a package to a driver (not blank) and it&#39;s different from a previously assigned driver.</p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Click on the section Do this: We send an email to the package driver.</li>
</ol>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Deploy your app" duration="0">
        <p>Now it&#39;s time to see your app in action! For that, on the left navigation bar, click on Not Deployed. You will see a bunch of warnings that should be addressed before deploying the app. For simplicity, we will go ahead and deploy by clicking on Move app to deployed state despite errors.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/f4cf5848437aff80.png"></p>
<p>Congratulations! Your app has been deployed! To see a link to access your app, click on Users &gt; Links. Copy the Browser link and access your app!</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 624.00px" src="img/47795624db666694.png"></p>
